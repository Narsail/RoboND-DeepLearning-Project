# Write Up

## Project Steps

*
The student is able to identify the use of various reasons for encoding / decoding images, when it should be used, why it is useful, and any problems that may arise.
*

## Network Architecture

*
The student clearly explains each layer of the network architecture and the role that it plays in the overall network. The student can demonstrate the benefits and/or drawbacks of different network architectures pertaining to this project and can justify the current network with factual data. Any choice of configurable parameters should also be explained in the network architecture.

The student shall also provide a graph, table, diagram, illustration or figure for the overall network to serve as a reference for the reviewer.
*

*
The student demonstrates a clear understanding of 1 by 1 convolutions and where/when/how it should be used.

The student demonstrates a clear understanding of a fully connected layer and where/when/how it should be used.
*

## Parameter Tuning

*
The student explains their neural network parameters including the values selected and how these values were obtained (i.e. how was hyper tuning performed? Brute force, etc.) Hyper parameters include, but are not limited to:

Epoch
Learning Rate
Batch Size
Etc.
All configurable parameters should be explicitly stated and justified.
*

## What worked well and what not

*
The student is able to clearly articulate whether this model and data would work well for following another object (dog, cat, car, etc.) instead of a human and if not, what changes would be required.
*

## Future Enhancements
